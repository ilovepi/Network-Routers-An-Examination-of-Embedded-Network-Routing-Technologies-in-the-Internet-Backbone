	abstract = {Security is becoming the primary concern in today’s embedded systems. Network-on-chip (NoC)-based communication architectures have emerged as an alternative to shared bus mechanism in multi-core system-on-chip (SoC) devices and the increasing number and functionality of processing cores have made such systems vulnerable to security attacks. In this paper, a secure communication architecture has been presented by designing an identity and address verification (IAV) security module, which is embedded in each router at the communication level. IAV module verifies the identity and address range to be accessed by incoming and outgoing data packets in an NoC-based multi-core shared memory architecture. Our IAV module is implemented on an FPGA device for functional verification and evaluated in terms of its area and power consumption overhead. For FPGA-based systems, the IAV module can be reconfigured at run-time through partial reconfiguration. In addition, a cycle-accurate simulation is carried out to analyze the performance and total network energy consumption overhead for different network configurations. The proposed IAV module has presented reduced area and power consumption overhead when compared with similar existing solutions.},

Traffic shaping is typically implemented using token buckets, allowing a maximum burst of traffic to be serviced at the peak capacity of the link, while any remaining traffic is serviced at a lower shaping rate. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we develop an active end-to-end detection mechanism, referred to as ShaperProbe, that can infer whether a particular path is subject to traffic shaping, and in that case, estimate the shaper characteristics. Second, we analyze results from a large-scale deployment of ShaperProbe on M-Lab over the last 24 months, detecting traffic shaping in several major ISPs. Our deployment has received more than one million runs so far from 5,700 ISPs.},

	abstract = {In an industrial or technical context, some of the communications are strongly time-constrained. Our objective is to evaluate the service offered by a switched Ethernet architecture. We have chosen the network calculus theory because it gives a good representation of the exchanges and enables to determine the maximum end to end delays. Previous models implementing a strict priority policy presented in [A formal method to guarantee a deterministic behaviour of switched Ethernet networks for time-critical applications] are improved in order to take into account the Weighted Fair Queueing mechanism which enables to balance the allocation of the network to the different traffics regarding the time contraints they have to respect. This paper also presents the new analytical formulas which upper bound the maximum end-to-end delays of the time-critical messages over the whole network. This enables to determine the optimal bandwith dedicated to both critical and best effort traffics. On an industrial scenario, Strict Priority and Weighted Fair Queueing policies are finally compared.},

While TCP's congestion control algorithm is highly robust to diverse network conditions, its implicit assumption of end-system cooperation results in a well-known vulnerability to attack by high-rate non-responsive flows. In this paper, we investigate a class of low-rate denial of service attacks which, unlike high-rate attacks, are difficult for routers and counter-DoS mechanisms to detect. Using a combination of analytical modeling, simulations, and Internet experiments, we show that maliciously chosen low-rate DoS traffic patterns that exploit TCP's retransmission time-out mechanism can throttle TCP flows to a small fraction of their ideal rate while eluding detection. Moreover, as such attacks exploit protocol homogeneity, we study fundamental limits of the ability of a class of randomized time-out mechanisms to thwart such low-rate DoS attacks.},

Are there unintended negative effects through low-risk, low-cost technology-mediated participation? And, is there a difference - in both outcome and engagement level - between different types of online social activism?

If the end-host applications are aware of the compression already provided by an intermediary, they can save time and resources by not applying compression themselves. The benefits from these savings are even greater in mobile applications. We present a probing technique to detect the compression of traffic flows by intermediaries. Our technique is non-intrusive and robust to cross traffic. It is entirely end-to-end, requiring neither changes to nor information from intermediate nodes. We present two different but similar approaches based on how cooperative the end-hosts are. Our proposed technique only uses packet inter-arrival times for detection. It does not require synchronized clocks at the sender and receiver. Simulations and Internet experiments were used to evaluate our approach. Our findings demonstrate an accurate detection of compression applied to traffic flows by intermediaries.},

These lightweight, unforgeable signatures make senders accountable for traffic they originate. They also enable spoofing elimination close to sources since they are verified at each router hop. The second layer of the architecture introduces route- independent, lightweight, unforgeable and short-lived packet tickets that act as capabilities. They indicate that the packet's destination agrees to receive traffic from a given source and eliminate some common denial-of-service attacks close to sources because they are verified at each router hop. The top layer contains a reputation system that collects server reports about malicious client behaviors. Reports include verifiable proofs of malicious behavior, which prevents lying, and are aggregated into a client's reputation. Reputations provide information about previously unseen clients to servers that can use it to decide whether a client should be granted a ticket. Jointly, these three architectural layers introduce strong accountability into the future Internet.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDCS.1998.679778},
	abstract = {Ad-hoc networks are completely wireless networks of mobile hosts, in which the topology rapidly changes due to the movement of mobile hosts. This frequent topology may lead to sudden packet losses and delays. Transport protocols like TCP have been built mainly for reliable, fixed networks. Hence, when used in ad-hoc networks, TCP misinterprets this loss as congestion and invokes congestion control. This leads to unnecessary retransmissions and loss of throughput. To overcome this problem, a feedback scheme is proposed, so that the source can distinguish between route failure and network congestion. When a route is disrupted, the source is sent a route failure notification (RFN) packet, allowing it to freeze its timers and stop sending packets. When the route is re-established, the source is informed through a route re-establishment notification (RRN) packet, upon which it resumes by unfreezing timers and continuing packet transmissions. The simulated performance of TCP on ad-hoc networks with and without feedback is compared and reported. It is observed that in the event of route failures, as the route re-establishment time increases, the use of feedback provides significant gains in throughput as well as savings in unnecessary packet transmissions. Several further enhancements and directions for future work are also sketched},

Probes such as ICMP pings provide an effective tool for detecting compromised nodes which try to delay or drop traffic.

The solution to this problem is to create stealthy probes which are indistinguishable from normal application traffic.

	abstract = {Traffic differentiations are known to be found at the edge of the Internet in broadband ISPs and wireless carriers [13, 2]. The ability to detect traffic differentiations is essential for customers to develop effective strategies for improving their application performance. We build a system, called NetPolice, that enables detection of content- and routing-based differentiations in backbone ISPs. NetPolice is easy to deploy since it only relies on loss measurement launched from end hosts. The key challenges in building NetPolice include selecting an appropriate set of probing destinations and ensuring the robustness of detection results to measurement noise. We use NetPolice to study 18 large ISPs spanning 3 major continents over 10 weeks in 2008. Our work provides concrete evidence of traffic differentiations based on application types and neighbor ASes. We identify 4 ISPs that exhibit large degree of differentiation on 4 applications and 10 ISPs that perform previous-AS hop based differentiation, resulting in up to 5\% actual loss rate differences. The significance of differences increases with network load. Some ISPs simply differentiate traffic based on port numbers irrespective of packet payload and the differentiation policies may only be partially deployed within their networks. We also find strong correlation between performance differences and Type-of-Service value differences in the traffic.},

While PlanetLab cannot provide a perfectly-customized environment for every experiment, it has been changing over time, and the base of knowledge of how to best utilize it has also been growing. As a result, many of the early observations researchers made about PlanetLab would change if rechecked today. In this paper, we discuss these issues and explain whether they remain, have been addressed via PlanetLab's evolution, or can be avoided by the use of best practices. Where possible, we provide quantitative evidence showing the realities of PlanetLab and possible research avenues to further broaden the opportunities for using PlanetLab in network research.},

Where existing tomographic techniques try to form solvable systems of equations to infer network properties, we try to form {\textbackslash}emph\{un\}solvable systems that reveal neutrality violations.

SPQ is easy to implement and has low overhead. Using this scheduling algorithm guarantees acceptable service to high priority queues while in most cases it is not fair to low priority ones. SPQ can cause significant packet loss (and TCP connection drop in some cases) for low priority queues in a network. When packet loss and disconnections occur in TCP, the sender will start a new connection using TCP Slow Start which results in performance degradation, delay and inefficient bandwidth utilization. This project focuses on preventing the packet loss by utilizing a similar approach to the existing Freeze-TCP mechanism. This mechanism will be used in an intermediary node such as a middlebox to enhance performance.},

Our primary goal was on obtaining a breakdown of the computational energy cost of TCP at the sender and receiver (excluding radio energy costs) as a first step in developing techniques to reduce this cost in actual systems. We analyzed the energy consumption of TCP in FreeBSD 5 running on a wireless laptop. Our initial results showed that 60 - 70\% of the energy cost (for transmission or reception) is accounted for by the Kernel -- NIC (Network Interface Card) copy operation. Of the remainder, 15\% is accounted for in the copy operation from user space to kernel space with the remaining 15\% being accounted for by TCP processing costs. We then further analyzed the TCP processing cost and determined the cost of computing checksums accounts for 20 -- 30\% of TCP processing cost.},

I survey the trajectory of network algorithmics, starting with a focus on speed and scale in the 1990s to measurement and security in the 2000s, using what I call the confluence lens. Confluence sees interdisciplinary work as a merger of two or more disciplines made compelling by an inflection point in the real world, while also producing genuinely transformed ideas. I attempt to show that Network Algorithmics represented a confluence in the 1990s between computer systems, algorithms, and networking. I suggest confluence diagrams as a means to identify future interdisciplinary opportunities, and describe the emerging field of network verification as a new confluence between networking and programming languages.},

Priority queues are used to implement highest-priority-first scheduling policies. Our hardware architecture is based on a new data structure called a pipelined heap, or P-heap for short. This data structure enables the pipelining of the enqueue and dequeue operations, thereby allowing these operations to execute in essentially constant time. In addition to being very fast, the architecture also scales very well to a large number of priority levels and to large queue sizes. We give a detailed description of this new data structure, the associated algorithms and the corresponding hardware implementation. We have implemented this new architecture using a 0.35 micron CMOS technology. Our current implementation can support 10 Gb/s connections with over 4 billion priority levels},

The analysis of the data provides a comprehensive summary about current protocol usage including comparisons to prior studies. Furthermore, header misbehaviors and anomalies were found within almost every aspect analyzed and are discussed in detail.

In this paper, we propose a framework that could be used to blindly discover a firewall policy remotely as a black box and without prior knowledge about the network configuration. We show how an attacker can reconstruct a firewall's policy by probing the firewall with tailored packets into a network and forming an idea of what the policy looks like. The proposed methodology shows how to discover a policy that is semantically equivalent to the original one used in the deployed firewall. Three techniques are proposed for reconstructing the policy as well as to intelligently choose the probing packets adaptively based on the firewall response. We show the possibility of obtaining the deployed policy in a feasible time with acceptable accuracy.},

Without such metrics, it is impossible to measure severity of various attacks, quantify success of proposed defenses, and compare their performance. Existing DoS metrics equate service denial with slow communication, low throughput, high resource utilization, and high loss rate. These metrics are not versatile because they fail to monitor all traffic parameters that signal service degradation. They are not quantitative because they fail to specify exact ranges of parameter values that correspond to good or poor service quality. Finally, they are not accurate since they were not proven to correspond to human perception of service denial. We propose several DoS impact metrics that measure the quality of service experienced by users during an attack. Our metrics are quantitative: they map QoS requirements for several applications into measurable traffic parameters with acceptable, scientifically determined thresholds. They are versatile: they apply to a wide range of attack scenarios, which we demonstrate via testbed experiments and simulations. We also prove metrics' accuracy through testing with human users.},

	abstract = {Middleboxes are an essential part of today's networks since they allow to introduce additional functionality without having to change end-hosts. Network Address Translation (NAT) has been the number one choice for coping with the address depletion problem of IPv4. Although NAT introduces many problems for existing applications it can be found in almost every consumer and mobile network. Large Scale NAT (LSN) is the latest trend in middlebox deployment and plays an important role for the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. LSN may consist of a distributed NAT at the provider or it may include multiple layers of NAT. LSN introduces additional problems for customers since many existing NAT traversal techniques cannot be applied. This paper presents an approach for discovering and measuring stateful cascaded NATs on the path between two arbitrary peers in the Internet. An algorithm combining multiple UDP packets, individual timeouts and traceroute measurements is presented and evaluated in a public field test. Finally, we show how NAT traversal for LSN can be improved by parameterizing existing algorithms according to the detected topology.},

	abstract = {Today's networks deploy many stateful procesing boxes ranging from NATs to firewalls and application optimizers: these boxes operate on packet flows, rather than individual packets. As more and more middleboxes are deployed, understanding their composition is becoming increasingly difficult. Static checking of network configurations is a promising approach to help understand whether a network is configured properly, but existing tools are limited as they only support stateless processing. We propose to use symbolic execution---a technique prevalent in compilers---to check network properties more general than basic reachability. The key idea is to track the possible values for specified fields in the packet as it travels through a network. Each middlebox or router will impose constraints on certain fields of the packet via forwarding actions, packet modifications and filtering. The symbolic approach also allows us to model middlebox per-flow state in a scalable way. We have implemented this technique in a tool we call SymNet and conducted preliminary evaluation. Early results show SymNet scales well and models basic stateful middleboxes, opening the possibility of analyzing complex stateful middlebox behaviours.},

	abstract = {Internet line speeds are expected to reach 100 Gbps in a few years. To match these line rates, a single router line card needs to forward more than 150 million packets per second. This requires a corresponding amount of longest prefix match operations. Furthermore, the increased use of IPv6 requires core routers to perform the longest prefix match on several hundred thousand prefixes varying in length up to 64 bits. It is a challenge to scale existing algorithms simultaneously in the three dimensions of increased throughput, table size and prefix length. Recently, Bloom filter-based IP lookup algorithms have been proposed. While these algorithms can take advantage of hardware parallelism and fast on-chip memory to achieve high performance, they have significant drawbacks (discussed in the paper) that impede their use in practice. In this paper, we present the distributed and load balanced bloom filters to address these drawbacks. We develop the practical IP lookup algorithm for use in 100 Gbps line cards. The regular and modular hardware architecture of our scheme directly maps to the state-of-art ASICs and FPGAs with reasonable resource consumption. Also, our scheme outperforms TCAMs on most metrics including cost, power dissipation, and board footprint.},

However, this has been focused on the user application experience or on a fixed networking stack. Rather than running custom data planes in user space or running separate guest operating systems, both of which come at a performance hit, we propose running a single kernel-level custom data-plane by synthesizing the configuration of the per-virtual-network data planes. In this paper we present this idea using Click, where packet processing is specified as an interconnection of fixed networking tasks. We then demonstrate the idea using an unvirtualized Linux kernel as the target platform, showing how we provided isolation between the customized data plane.},

One such approach for efficient and effective monitoring is probing. Probes such as ICMP pings are an effective tool for detecting network nodes which have been compromised by an attacker who tries to delay or drop traffic passing through the captured node. However an intelligent attacker may evade detection by giving preferential treatment to probe traffic. This is usually possible because probe packets have a different format from regular application packets and are easily distinguishable. Hence, it is important to probe in a stealthy manner so as to avoid identification of probes by an attacker and to ensure the collection of accurate system health statistics. In this paper, we review design approaches for generating stealthy probes and describe various possible mechanisms that can be used for such a design. These approaches are evaluated according to the design criteria and we identify what may be feasible solutions for stealthy probing in battlefield ad-hoc wireless networks.},

	abstract = {Differentiated Services (DiffServ) networks categorize routers into edge routers and core routers. In core routers, one of the technological challenges is how to implement differentiated bandwidth allocation and TCP protection together with low complexity. We present an Active Queue Management (AQM) scheme called CHOKeW. A method is borrowed from a previous scheme, CHOKe, which draws a packet at random from the buffer, compares it with the arriving packet, and drops both if they are from the same flow. CHOKeW enhances the drawing function by adjusting the maximum number of draws based on the priority of the new arrival and the current status of network congestion. With respect to the number of flows, both the memory-requirement complexity and the per-packet-processing complexity for CHOKeW is O(1). An analytical model and multiple simulations are used to explain and evaluate CHOKeW. We show that CHOKeW is able to (1) support differentiated bandwidth allocation; (2) provide the flows in the same priority with better fairness than other conventional stateless AQM schemes such as RED and BLUE; (3) maintain high link utilization as well as short queue length; and (4) protect TCP flows by restricting the bandwidth share of high-speed unresponsive flows.},

Conventional approaches to solving this problem consider the existing best-effort class as the low-priority class, and attempt to develop mechanisms that provide "better-than-best-effort" service. In this paper, we explore the opposite approach, and devise a new distributed algorithm to realize a low-priority service (as compared to the existing best effort) from the network endpoints. To this end, we develop TCP Low Priority (TCP-LP), a distributed algorithm whose goal is to utilize only the excess network bandwidth as compared to the "fair share" of bandwidth as targeted by TCP. The key mechanisms unique to TCP-LP congestion control are the use of one-way packet delays for early congestion indications and a TCP-transparent congestion avoidance policy. The results of our simulation and Internet experiments show that: 1) TCP-LP is largely non-intrusive to TCP traffic; 2) both single and aggregate TCP-LP flows are able to successfully utilize excess network bandwidth; moreover, multiple TCP-LP flows share excess bandwidth fairly; 3) substantial amounts of excess bandwidth are available to the low-priority class, even in the presence of "greedy" TCP flows; 4) the response times of web connections in the best-effort class decrease by up to 90\% when long-lived bulk data transfers use TCP-LP rather than TCP; 5) despite their low-priority nature, TCP-LP flows are able to utilize significant amounts of available bandwidth in a wide-area network environment.},

Existing systems for detecting discrimination are typically specific to an application or to a particular discrimination mechanism and rely on active measurement tests. Unfortunately, ISPs can change discrimination policies and mechanisms, and they can evade these tests by giving probe traffic higher priority. NANO detects ISP discrimination by passively collecting performance data from clients. To distinguish discrimination from other causes of degradation (e.g., overload, misconfiguration, failure), NANO establishes a causal relationship between an ISP and observed performance by adjusting for confounding factors. NANO agents deployed at participating clients across the Internet collect performance data for selected services and report this information to centralized servers, which analyze the measurements to establish causal relationship between an ISP and performance degradations. We have implemented NANO and deployed clients in a controlled environment on Emulab. We run a combination of controlled experiments on Emulab and wide-area experiments on PlanetLab that show that NANO can determine the extent and criteria for discrimination for a variety of discrimination policies and applications.},

	abstract = {Many distributed applications can make use of large background transfers--transfers of data that humans are not waiting for--to improve availability, reliability, latency or consistency. However, given the rapid fluctuations of available network bandwidth and changing resource costs due to technology trends, hand tuning the aggressiveness of background transfers risks (1) complicating applications, (2) being too aggressive and interfering with other applications, and (3) being too timid and not gaining the benefits of background transfers. Our goal is for the operating system to manage network resources in order to provide a simple abstraction of near zero-cost background transfers. Our system, TCP Nice, can provably bound the interference inflicted by background flows on foreground flows in a restricted network model. And our microbenchmarks and case study applications suggest that in practice it interferes little with foreground flows, reaps a large fraction of spare network bandwidth, and simplifies application construction and deployment. For example, in our prefetching case study application, aggressive prefetching improves demand performance by a factor of three when Nice manages resources; but the same prefetching hurts demand performance by a factor of six under standard network congestion control.},

	abstract = {Clicks is a new software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queuing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router configurable is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex configurations easier to write, including pull connections, which model packet flow drivn by transmitting hardware devices, and flow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements. Click configurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click IP router has 16 elements on its forwarding path; some of its elements are also useful in Ethernet switches and IP tunnelling configurations. Extending the IP router to support dropping policies, fairness among flows, or Differentiated Services simply requires adding a couple of element at the right place. On conventional PC hardware, the Click IP router achieves a maximum loss-free forwarding rate of 333,000 64-byte packets per second, demonstrating that Click's modular and flexible architecture is compatible with good performance.},

Moreover, CFI enforcement is practical: it is compatible with existing software and can be done efficiently using software rewriting in commodity systems.

First, it considers the more realistic case of non-persistent TCP flows with heavy-tailed size distribution. Second, instead of only looking at link metrics, we focus on the impact of buffer sizing on TCP performance. Specifically, our goal is to find the buffer size that maximizes the average per-flow TCP throughput. Through a combination of testbed experiments, simulation, and analysis, we reach the following conclusions. The output/input capacity ratio at a network link largely determines the required buffer size. If that ratio is larger than one, the loss rate drops exponentially with the buffer size and the optimal buffer size is close to zero. Otherwise, if the output/input capacity ratio is lower than one, the loss rate follows a power-law reduction with the buffer size and significant buffering is needed, especially with flows that are mostly in congestion-avoidance. Smaller transfers, which are mostly in slow-start, require significantly smaller buffers. We conclude by revisiting the ongoing debate on "small versus large" buffers from a new perspective.},

UDP is a lightweight protocol that allows applications to make direct use of the unreliable datagram service provided by the underlying IP service. UDP is commonly used to support applications that use simple query/response transactions, or applications that support real-time communications. TCP provides a reliable data-transfer service, and is used for both bulk data transfer and interactive data applications. TCP is the major transport protocol in use in most IP networks, and supports the transfer of over 90 percent of all traffic across the public Internet today. Given this major role for TCP, the performance of this protocol forms a significant part of the total picture of service performance for IP networks. In this article we examine TCP in further detail, looking at what makes a TCP session perform reliably and well.

	abstract = {There have been may debates about the feasibility of providing guaranteed quality of service (QoS) when network traffic travels beyond the enterprise domain and into the vast unknown of the Internet. Many mechanisms have been proposed to bring QoS to TCP/IP and the Internet (RSVP, DiffServ, 802.1p). However, until these techniques and the equipment to support them become ubiquitous, most enterprises will rely on local prioritization of the traffic to obtain the best performance for mission-critical and time-sensitive applications. This paper explores prioritizing critical TCP/IP traffic using a multi-queue buffer management strategy that becomes biased against random low-priority flows and remains biased while congestion exists in the network. This biasing implies a degree of unfairness but proves to be more advantageous to the overall throughput of the network than strategies that attempt to be fair. Only two classes of service are considered, where TCP connections are assigned to these classes and mapped to two underlying queues with round-robin scheduling and shared memory. In addition to improving the throughput, cell losses are minimized for the class of service (queue) with the higher priority},

While such an attack can significantly degrade the performance of all TCP-based protocols and services including Internet routing (e.g., BGP), no existing scheme clearly solves the problem in real network scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple protection mechanism, called SAP (Shrew Attack Protection), for defending against a Shrew attack. Rather than attempting to track and isolate Shrew attackers, SAP identifies TCP victims by monitoring their drop rates and preferentially admits those packets from victims with high drop rates to the output queue. This is to ensure that well-behaved TCP sessions can retain their bandwidth shares. Our simulations indicate that under a Shrew attack, SAP can prevent TCP sessions from closing, and effectively enable TCP flows to maintain high throughput. SAP is a destination-port-based mechanism and requires only a small number of counters to find potential victims, which makes SAP readily implementable on top of existing router mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Delay-insensitive applications such as P2P file sharing, data center backups and software updates generate substantial amounts of traffic. This traffic, transported potentially over multiple TCP connections, competes with traffic from other possibly interactive applications. Today, with TCP, they compete on an equal level for each individual connection. In this paper, we propose a new TCP variant for such delay-insensitive applications, which we call Network Friendly TCP (NF-TCP). NF-TCP is responsive to available bandwidth, seeking to quickly and efficiently utilize the same in a congestion-free situation, while backing-off more aggressively than standard TCP on encountering competing traffic in a congested network. NF-TCP uses a novel combination of utilizing measurement of available bandwidth and ECN-based congestion avoidance techniques to ensure that it is truly friendly to existing TCP connections. We evaluate the performance of NF-TCP through ns-2 simulations and present the initial results enlightening the friendly nature of NF-TCP compared to standard TCP.},

	abstract = {Packet forwarding prioritization (PFP) in routers is one of the mechanisms commonly available to network administrators. PFP can have a significant impact on the performance of applications, the accuracy of measurement tools' results and the effectiveness of network troubleshooting procedures. Despite their potential impact, no information on PFP settings is readily available to end users. In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach for packet forwarding priority inference and its associated tool, POPI. This is the first attempt to infer router packet-forwarding priority through end-to-end measurement. Our POPI tool enables users to discover such network policies through the monitoring and rank classification of loss rates for different packet types. We validated our approach via statistical analysis, simulation, and wide-area experimentation in PlanetLab. As part of our wide-area experiments, we employed POPI to analyze 156 random paths across 162 PlanetLab nodes. We discovered 15 paths flagged with multiple priorities, 13 of which were further validated through hop-by-hop loss rates measurements. In addition, we surveyed all related network operators and received responses for about half of them confirming our inferences.},

	abstract = {Initiatives to add mobility to the Internet and packet data services in third-generation (3G) cellular systems are being considered as candidate solutions for the delivery or IP data to mobile users. The Transport Control Protocol (TCP) will continue to be the most widely used transport protocol for a certain duration in 3G cellular Internet networks. Initially designed for high-speed wireline networks where random packet loss can be negligible, TCP can yield a significant throughput deterioration when applied to lossy links without modification since the primary cause of packet loss may not be network congestion. Two new types of loss can dominate TCP's performance: one is dropped packets because of route disconnection from frequent handoffs; the other is relatively high bit error rate (BER) of radio propagation channels due to multipath fading. Unlike much or the early TCP studies that largely relied on simulations, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis by modeling typical TCP congestion control algorithms. We adopt finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) model as the basis of link error definition since in typical cases it is not adequate to model a radio communication channel as a two-state Gilbert-Elliott channel when the channel quality varies dramatically. To enhance TCP performance in cellular networks, we adopt the idea of active-mobile-host to constrain the negative effect of handoff on TCP throughput in a minimized range. The accuracy of our analytical model is verified through the comparison with measurements using UCB/LBNL Network Simulator (ns-2).},

We compare the service behavior and show that WRR is not only more fair but also more flexible for QoS provision. To exhibit the potential and flexibility enabled by WRR, we develop a weight allocation algorithm to automatically assign proper weights for individual flows to satisfy their delay constraints. In particular, the weights are assigned in a way not more than necessary, in other words, to approach flows' delay constraints in order to leave room for other flows. Our experimental results validate our analysis technique and algorithms.},

Our results show that 60-70\% of the energy cost (for transmission or reception) is accounted for by the kernel NIC (network interface card) copy operation. Of the remainder, /spl sim/15\% is accounted for in the copy operation from user space to kernel space with the remaining 15\% being accounted for by TCP processing costs. We then further analyze the 15\% TCP processing cost and show that the cost of computing checksums accounts for 20-30\% of TCP processing cost. Finally, we determine the processing costs of two primary TCP functions - timeouts and triple duplicate ACKs. Pulling all these costs together, we present techniques whereby energy savings of between 20\%-30\% in the computational cost of TCP can be achieved.},

Started as a scalable tool to continuously monitor packets that flow on a link, Tstat has evolved into a complex application that gives network researchers and operators the possibility to derive extended and complex measurements thanks to advanced traffic classifiers. After discussing Tstat capabilities and internal design, we present some examples of measurements collected deploying Tstat at the edge of several ISP networks in past years. While other works report a continuous decline of P2P traffic with streaming and file hosting services rapidly increasing in popularity, the results presented in this article picture a different scenario. First, P2P decline has stopped, and in the last months of 2010 there was a counter tendency to increase P2P traffic over UDP, so the common belief that UDP traffic is negligible is not true anymore. Furthermore, streaming and file hosting applications have either stabilized or are experiencing decreasing traffic shares. We then discuss the scalability issues software-based tools have to cope with when deployed in real networks, showing the importance of properly identifying bottlenecks.},

Because current Internet provides only offer best effort services, packet scheduling algorithms supporting quality of service (QoS) requirements play an important part in switches and routers. This paper discusses a new packet scheduling discipline called zero latency queuing scheduler (ZLQS), which has one special zero latency queue (ZLQ) for real time traffic flows. When a packet comes to the ZLQ, it is serviced at a time from en-queue to de-queue without queuing latencies. The ZLQS offers zero latency queuing for real time traffic flows, and in addition it supports not only committed rate (CR)1 but also peak rate (PR)2 or burst rate (BR) for the bandwidth reservation. The ZLQS is a frame-based scheduler like deficit round robin (DRR), and therefore has the good properties of simple implementation at high speeds routers or switches, per packet work complexity of O(l) and almost perfect fairness.},

Recent studies have shed the light on their impact on real traffic and the complexity of managing them. Network operators and researchers have few tools to understand the impact of those boxes on any path. In this paper, we propose tracebox, an extension to the widely used traceroute tool, that is capable of detecting various types of middlebox interference over almost any path. tracebox sends IP packets containing TCP segments with different TTL values and analyses the packet encapsulated in the returned ICMP messages. Further, as recent routers quote, in the ICMP message, the entire IP packet that they received, tracebox is able to detect any modification performed by upstream middleboxes. In addition, tracebox can often pinpoint the network hop where the middlebox interference occurs. We evaluate tracebox with measurements performed on PlanetLab nodes. Our analysis reveals various types of middleboxes that were not expected on such an experimental testbed supposed to be connected to the Internet without any restriction.},

We describe I-TCP, which is an indirect transport layer protocol for mobile hosts. I-TCP utilizes the resources of Mobility Support Routers (MSRs) to provide transport layer communication between mobile hosts and hosts on the fixed network. With I-TCP, the problems related to mobility and unreliability of wireless link are handled entirely within the wireless link; the TCP/IP software on the fixed hosts is not modified. Using I-TCP on our testbed, the throughput between a fixed host and a mobile host improved substantially in comparison to regular TCP},

	abstract = {As part of the wider debate over net neutrality, traffic management practices of Internet Service Providers have become an issue of public concern. The Federal Communications Commission has asked for public input on whether deep packet inspection and other traffic management practices are reasonable forms of network management. Little attention has been paid to this issue within the academic networking community, and most Internet policy researchers have recommended a case-by-case analysis. This paper proposes a framework for the classification of traffic management practices as reasonable or unreasonable. I suggest that whether a traffic management practice is reasonable largely rests on the answers to four questions regarding the techniques and practices used. Based on these questions, I propose a framework that classifies techniques as unreasonable if they are unreasonably anti-competitive, cause undue harm to consumers, or unreasonably impair free speech. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of how some unreasonable traffic management practices can be more directly and transparently accomplished through alternative practices that would be classified as reasonable.},

	abstract = {The Internet has led to the creation of a digital society, where (almost) everything is connected and is accessible from anywhere. However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this - ew paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms - with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security, and dependability - as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},

In this paper, we first identify various attacks that are effective to several representative time synchronization schemes, and then focus on a specific type of attack called delay attack, which cannot be addressed by cryptographic techniques. Next we propose two approaches to detect and accommodate the delay attack. Our first approach uses the generalized extreme studentized deviate (GESD) algorithm to detect multiple outliers introduced by the compromised nodes; our second approach uses a threshold derived using a time transformation technique to filter out the outliers. Finally we show the effectiveness of these two schemes through extensive simulations},

The reports have sparked an intense and wide-ranging policy debate on network neutrality and ISP traffic management practices. However, to date, end users lack access to measurement tools that can detect whether their access ISPs are blocking their BitTorrent traffic. And since ISPs do not voluntarily disclose their traffic management policies, no one knows how widely BitTorrent traffic blocking is deployed in the current Internet. In this paper, we address this problem by designing an easy-to-use tool to detect BitTorrent blocking and by presenting results from a widely used public deployment of the tool.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a real-time anomaly detection framework for an NoC-based many-core architecture. We assume that processing cores and memories are safe and anomaly is included through a communication medium (i.e., router). The article targets three different attacks, namely, traffic diversion, route looping, and core address spoofing attacks. The attacks are detected by using machine-learning techniques. Comprehensive analysis on machine-learning algorithms suggests that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) have better attack detection efficiency. It has been observed that both algorithms have accuracy in the range of 94\% to 97\%. Additional hardware complexity analysis advocates SVM to be implemented on hardware. To test the framework, we implement a condition-based attack insertion module; attacks are performed intra- and intercluster. The proposed real-time anomaly detection framework is fully placed and routed on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Postplace and -route implementation results show that SVM has 12\% to 2\% area overhead and 3\% to 1\% power overhead for the quad-core and 16-core implementation, respectively. It is also observed that it takes 25\% to 18\% of the total execution time to detect an anomaly in transferred packets for quad-core and 16-core, respectively. The proposed framework achieves 65\% reduction in area overhead and is 3 times faster compared to previous published work.},

	abstract = {The increasing adoption of high speed Internet connectivity in homes has led to the development of bandwidth hungry applications. This, in turn, induces ISPs to protect their core networks by deploying traffic shaping devices. End users, ISPs and regulators need to better understand the shaping policies that are enforced by the network. The paper presents a method for inferring flow discrimination and shaping parameters in the presence of cross traffic using active probing. The key concept is a stochastic comparison of the inter-arrival times of packets and measured bandwidth of a base-line flow and the measured flow. We present Packsen, a framework designed to provide high detection accuracy by sending interleaved flows at a very precise bandwidth, and used it for measurements on a local testbed and on PlanetLab. Evaluation shows the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method for detecting traffic shaping and inferring its parameters.},

In this paper, we present and analyse through simulations using functional testbed routing agents, TCP throughput performance during a route break event. The results of our analysis on three popular routing protocols, namely AODV, DSR and OLSR, produces insight into the different behavioural patterns of TCP during this event, and highlights the mechanisms of each routing protocol that affect it. Further, trade-offs in the choice of the routing parameters with respect to TCP performance are discussed.},

This paper summarizes the concept and origination of net neutrality, as well as the typical opinions of the proponents and opponents on net neutrality. It takes Comcast as an example, analyses the reason and measurement that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) enforced discriminatory access and blocking. We argue that peer-to-peer (P2P) softwares don't harm the whole quality of Internet; they just transfer the pressure from Content Providers (CPs) to ISPs. And the only loss caused by P2P protocols is that ISPs can't get premium revenues from CPs. We suggest that net neutrality should be preserved and regulated. Meanwhile, the government should stimulate the investment incentives of ISPs to encourage the deployment and optimization of new broadband network. If market forces can't achieve this goal, some market measures would be necessary.},

	abstract = {In the nodes of computer networks the Active Queue Management (AQM) is responsible for managing the messages to be transmitted. Because of the time required for this service the messages delay in the nodes. This delay is much larger than a message transmission time is. The delays of these services lead to the congestion problem. These services can be examined as typical control systems. Although studies indicate that in AQM systems a PI controller works better than a TCP/IP RED algorithm, in a simplified model of TCP these differences decrease the effectiveness of the controller which was designed by the classical control theory. In these cases the structure of the Differentiated Services is proposed to apply to achieve adequate levels of the QoS services in a TCP/IP network. In this article an AQM system is designed, which is met on the demands of intensive usage and it includes the round trip delays as well as detection of lost packets if any. To achieve our goals, a predictive sliding mode control system (SMC) is designed to control congestion. This control strategy helps us to take into consideration the effects of round trip time, too. Implementation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in providing queue management.},

While providing large bandwidth through WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing), the main design challenge of conventional hybrid PNoC lies in the control layer, which is generally used for path set-up and also for short message communication. In this paper, we propose architecture and design of an efficient router for control and communication in heterogeneous Many-core Hybrid Photonic Network-on-Chip (2D-PHENIC).

Seattle is community-driven -- universities donate available compute resources on multi-user machines to the platform. These donations can come from systems with a wide variety of operating systems and architectures, removing the need for a dedicated infrastructure. Seattle is also surprisingly flexible and supports a variety of pedagogical uses because as a platform it represents a common denominator for cloud computing, grid computing, peer-to-peer networking, distributed systems, and networking. Seattle programs are portable. Students' code can run across different operating systems and architectures without change, while the Seattle programming language is expressive enough for experimentation at a fine-grained level. Our current deployment of Seattle consists of about one thousand computers that are distributed around the world. We invite the computer science education community to employ Seattle in their courses.},

The results are then collected on a central server and made publicly available to allow constant monitoring of the state of the Internet by interested parties. In this article we describe how we enhanced Neubot architecture both to deploy a distributed broadband speed test and to allow the development of plug-in transmission tests.

	abstract = {Click is a new software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queueing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. Complete configurations are built by connecting elements into a graph; packets flow along the graph's edges. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex configurations easier to write, including pull processing, which models packet flow driven by transmitting interfaces, and flow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements.We demonstrate several working configurations, including an IP router and an Ethernet bridge. These configurations are modular---the IP router has 16 elements on the forwarding path---and easy to extend by adding additional elements, which we demonstrate with augmented configurations. On commodity PC hardware running Linux, the Click IP router can forward 64-byte packets at 73,000 packets per second, just 10\% slower than Linux alone.},

Node A can transmit successfully only if it is able to "insert" its packets into the small inter-packet gaps of C's packets. Thus, we refer to the topology in Fig. 1(a) as the unfair topology and to C and A as the superior and inferior nodes respectively.},

There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling.[2] As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,[3] parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.[4]},

We define service differentiation as any attempt to change the performance of network traffic traversing an ISP's boundaries. ISPs may implement differentiation policies for a number of reasons, including load balancing, bandwidth management, or business reasons. Specifically, we focus on detecting whether certain types of network traffic receive better (or worse) performance. As an example, a wireless provider might limit the performance of third-party VoIP or video calling services (or any other competing services) by introducing delays or reducing transfer rates to encourage users to use services provided by the wireless provider. Previous work explored this problem in limited environments. Glasnost focused on BitTorrent in the desktop/laptop environment, and lacked the ability to conduct controlled experiments to provide strong evidence of differentiation. NetDiff covered a wide range of passively gathered traffic from a large ISP but likewise did not support targeted, controlled experiments. We address these limitations with Mobile Replay.},

Various cases of traffic differentiation at the Internet access have been reported throughout the last decade, in particular aimed at bandwidth consuming traffic flows. In this paper we present a novel application-agnostic method for the detection of traffic differentiation, through which we are able to correctly identify where a shaper is located with respect to the user and evaluate whether it affected delays, packet losses or both. The tool we propose, ChkDiff, replays the user's own traffic in order to target routers at the first few hops from the user. By comparing the resulting flow delays and losses to the same router against one other, and analyzing the behaviour on the immediate router topology spawning from the user end-point, ChkDiff manages to detect instances of traffic shaping. We provide a detailed description of the design of the tool for the case of upstream traffic, the technical issues it overcomes and a validation in controlled scenarios.},

The crux of the paper is that libraries, such as lib C contain sufficient diversity to allow a clever attacker to construct arbitrary computation by use of gadgets. The gadgets may or may not be complete instruction sequences, but by correctly indexing into these gadgets an attacker can make use of what is essentially a hidden instruction, similar to the way the word 'bridge' appears in the word 'abridge'.
The author details how we can create instruction primitives by using these gadgets in careful sequences. Once the user has these primitives they can begin crafting their expoit by chaining them together. 
In essence the attacker is creating a new instruction set with the gadgets.
