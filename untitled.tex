\section{Introduction}
Embedded systems encompass a wide array of commodity hardware, from low power
wearable devices, to large scale electro-mechanical systems. Network routers
are an example of a very specialized embedded device, focused on facilitating
digital communications. These routers range in size and power from small home
network routers, to the industrial level devices that make up the backbone of
the Internet. While all routers perform a common set of operations, i.e.\ the
routing and forwarding of network data, there are drastic differences in
performance, architecture, and capabilities between Core Routers and
counterparts found in enterprise and home networks.

The Internet backbone is composed of various government and Internet Service
Provider (ISP) controlled network infrastructure, generally made up of Core and
Edge routers. Edge routers differ from Core routers in their capacity and
filtering capabilities, and are designed to provide a gateway to the core
routers and the rest of the internet. In many cases these edge routers
previously served as core routers, but have been replaced by better performing
hardware. This is a simplification of a very heavily layered model of network
communications, composed of enterprise and consumer routers and switches
working in concert to provide security and service guarantees to end users. The
focus of this Survey is on the hardware and software capabilities available in
the routers making up the Internet Backbone.
